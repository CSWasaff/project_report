cs483 project 2 : graycell images


Project 2 is intended to support the core competencies of Incident Response/Handling and Digital forensics taught in class, as well as the Host Forensics Challenge for the National Security Agency / Service Academy Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX).

As a part of the CDX, there is an entity called the "Grey-Cell". The Grey-Cell is meant to simulate typical users/computers on an enterprise network. These machines are presented to each team in their pre-built environments and are assumed to be unpatched, vulnerable to exploitation, and likely already compromised by malware! 

Early in the semester, several (typically 2 Unix-based and 2 Windows-based) Grey-Cell computer images will be released to you. The goal of the project is to acquire, analyze, and report as many suscpicious artifacts and findings as possible with the intent of delivering a detailed and organized accounting of your analysis to supplement the Host Forensics CDX team. This accounting may include extracted and stored copies of malicious binaries running in memory, for example. 

In addition to the report, you will be required to develop a script that will verify the malicious artificats thath you found have been removed successfully.

Your report should:
 - Follow the forensic process and adhere to forensic investigative principles.â—¦What have my actions done to tamper the image being analyzed?
 - Follow the Order of Volatility according to what we know about the memory hierarchy.
 - Follow any rules of engagement (ROE) given by the CDX challenge.
 - Acquire "best" evidence, to strengthen your findings.

 - Explain in great detail the steps you took to acquire, analyze, and extract information / data (tools, techniques, cite sources you used).
 - Include code (home grown or borrowed) that you used and the command line switches/syntax required (others that read your report should be able to replicate your findings and methods).
 - Provide a detailed explanation of separation of work and research among team members.

Lastly, you will present your findings, either infront of the class or with your instructor in the format of an executive summary style briefing, similar to that of an investigatior's brief to leadership.
